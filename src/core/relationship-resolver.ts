/**
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Summary:
 * 
 * The `RelationshipResolver` class plays a crucial role in enabling foreign
 * key relationship resolution during the database seeding process.
 * 
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Maintains a central `state` object that tracks inserted records for each table.
 *   Example: { users: [ { id: 1, name: 'Miit' }, ... ], posts: [ ... ] }
 * - Allows adding new records to the state after each table is seeded.
 * - Supports fetching a random record from a parent table, which is essential
 *   when generating foreign keys (e.g., assigning a random `userId` to a `post`).
 * - Exposes a getter (`dbState`) so that custom generators or other logic
 *   can access the full snapshot of inserted data during seeding.
 * 
 * Importance:
 * This class ensures that dependent tables can safely and randomly reference
 * existing data from parent tables. Without it, generating valid foreign key
 * values during seeding would not be possible.
 * 
 * It will be especially important when building the final step of seeding logic
 * â€” replacing `__ref__table.field` placeholders with actual values.
